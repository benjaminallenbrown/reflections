When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you go between multiple machines, collaborate with others, or just want to preserve your work in case something happens to your personal computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Errors could be introduced otherwise, or conflicting things from other people's contributions.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is on GitHub only; it is a different version of someone else's project. A clone is copying that project, or one locally, without attribution and without doing it on GitHub. A branch is within a repository, and it is a different branch of the code rather than a copy of the entire thing.
